summary:  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by TEDxBGSU. 

abstract: In our daily lives, we are driven to compare ourselves with others and seek respect, influence, and power. This often involves positioning ourselves in relation to others. Additionally, we seek connection through the expression of affection, care, and love, aiming to find a sense of belonging and security. Sometimes, we utilize our status to assist others, whether through teaching, counseling, or parenting. The notions of positioning and connection are omnipresent in our lives. Consider the walnut tree, a magnificent example of nature with its robust and vibrant foliage. However, the substances emitted by walnut trees are toxic to other plants, creating an inhospitable environment around them. In contrast, companion planting, the practice of planting certain vegetables and plants near each other, can be mutually beneficial. For instance, marigolds are excellent companions, offering protection to a wide variety of plants against pests and harmful weeds. Power is often linked to high status, but it can also be interpreted as the ability to influence others. Conversely, our innate desire to connect with others, known as linking, is essential for building meaningful and healthy relationships. Love could be seen as an intensified form of connection.
