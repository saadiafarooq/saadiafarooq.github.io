abstract: This essay reflects lived experiences revealing the interplay between identity, motherhood, and cultural experience through the lens of poetic autoethnography. Utilizing poetic inquiry as a reflective tool for poetic transcription and analysis, I examine my personal journey as a migrant mother and a graduate student navigating the complexities of dual cultural identities – Pakistani heritage and American societal norms. Central to this exploration are the challenges of social and internal mental health stigma, the pressures of fulfilling familial roles, and the systemic barriers faced by marginalized families in the U.S. Through the framework of art-based research (ABR), poetic autoethnography, and the communication theory of identity; I reflect on my experiences, revealing the multifaceted layers of identity shaped by circumstances and societal expectations. The work highlights the ongoing negotiation of cultural heritage in raising children and pursuing academic aspirations, ultimately underscoring the necessity of understanding one’s identity as fluid and context dependent.
